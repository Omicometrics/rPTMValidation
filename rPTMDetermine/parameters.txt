[Search Results]

# 5. XTandem
# 6. MSFragger

# These should be the files used for database search, i.e., same .mgf files

# ** For those mass spectra files not recognized here, e.g., .raw from Thermal
#    Fisher, .wiff from SCIEX, they should be converted using tools like
#    Proteowizard, but must keep same file names.
# ** For the search using ProteinPilot which can combine multiple files to
#    search simultaneously and output a combined search results, the mass
#    spectra files should be exported using the software with .mgf format,
#    and the name must be same with the exported search results file (.txt

[Modification]

# Name does not exist) in be PSI-MS Name or Interim name Unimod database.
# For terminal modifications, use `nterm` and `cterm` for N-terminal and
# C-terminal modifications, separately. For example, `Carbamidomethyl@C` will
# exclude all carbamidomethylation on cysteine, and `Acetyl@nterm` to exclude
# N-terminal acetylation. Note that, if other modifications co-exist in a
# peptide, these modifications will also be considered during localization.
# Otherwise the identifications are excluded in the analysis.

# unmodified peptides and used for model construction.

# a single column with a name per line, no header is required. These names must
# be PSI-MS Name or Interim name (if PSI-MS Name does not exist) in Unimod
# database. The mass and sites of these modifications will be determined
# automatically from the Unimod database. Leave empty will use the identified
# modifications only.
# Full absolute directory or relative directory should be provided.
