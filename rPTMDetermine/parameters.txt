[Peptide Spectrum Matches]
# >>>>> Peptide spectrum match related parameters

# mass spectra and peptides with alternative modifications to correct the
# modifications assigned by database search. Default is 0.1 Da. Tolerance in
# ppm can also be used.

[Modification]
# >>>>> Modifications related parameters
# List of modifications excluded in the analysis, separated by `;` and no space
# between modifications. Each modification is presented as `name@site`, with
# name must be PSI-MS Name or Interim name (if PSI-MS Name does not exist) in
# Unimod database. For terminal modifications, use `nterm` for N-terminal and
# `cterm` for C-terminal modifications. For example, `Carbamidomethyl@C` will
# exclude all carbamidomethylation on cysteine, and `Acetyl@nterm` to exclude
# N-terminal acetylation. Note that, if other modifications co-exist in a
# peptide, these modificatios will also be considered during localization.
# Otherwise the identifications are excluded in the analysis.
excludes = Carbamidomethyl@C;Oxidation@M

# List of modifications considered for validation. Some of the modifications
# have been identified by database search. However, it may be possible that
# additional modifications are considered. All these modifications should be
# provided in a separate file (either `.csv` or `.txt` type file). Note that
# Excel files can't be recognized. The table is a single column with a name
# per line, no header is required. These names must be PSI-MS Name or Interim
# name (if PSI-MS Name does not exist) in Unimod database. The mass and sites
# of these modifications will be determined automatically from the Unimod
# database. Leave empty will use the modifications identified by database
# search only.
